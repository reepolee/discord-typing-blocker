# Discord "SomeUser is typing ..." notication blocker - Chrome Extension

## About

Disables sending live typing notification to Discord servers.

![SomeUser is typing ...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reepolee/discord-typing-blocker/main/typing.png)

Many times I start typing just to realize I was jumping at it too soon and clear the input. However, as the notification was sent already to the server, other party is expecting me to finish a response. Which now will never happen and it leads to all kinds of frustrations.

I believe this should be a setting in Discord app. Until it is, this extension helps.
